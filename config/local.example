/**
 * Local environment settings
 *
 * While you're developing your app, this config file should include
 * any settings specifically for your development computer (db passwords, etc.)
 * When you're ready to deploy your app in production, you can use this file
 * for configuration options on the server where it will be deployed.
 *
 *
 * PLEASE NOTE: 
 *		This file is included in your .gitignore, so if you're using git 
 *		as a version control solution for your Sails app, keep in mind that
 *		this file won't be committed to your repository!
 *
 *		Good news is, that means you can specify configuration for your local
 *		machine in this file without inadvertently committing personal information
 *		(like database passwords) to the repo.  Plus, this prevents other members
 *		of your team from commiting their local configuration changes on top of yours.
 *
 *
 * For more information, check out:
